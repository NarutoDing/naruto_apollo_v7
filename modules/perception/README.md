# Perception

## Introduction

The perception module incorporates the capability of using multiple cameras, radars (front and rear) and LiDARs to recognize obstacles and fuse their individual tracks to obtain a final track list.
The obstacle sub-module detects, classifies and tracks obstacles.
This sub-module also predicts obstacle motion and position information (e.g., heading and velocity).
For lane line, we construct lane instances by postprocessing lane parsing pixels and calculate the lane relative location to the ego-vehicle (L0, L1, R0, R1, etc.).

Apollo 7.0 Perception has following new features:

 * **SMOKE: Camera-based Obstacle Detection Model**
 * **Mask-Pillars: Lidar-based Obstacle Detection Model**

For more detail about new models, please refer to [Camera Perception in Apollo 7.0](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/perception/camera/README.md) and [Lidar Perception in Apollo 7.0](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/modules/perception/lidar/README.md)

## Architecture

The general architecture of the perception module is shown:

## Input

The perception module inputs are:

- 128 channel LiDAR data (cyber channel /apollo/sensor/velodyne128)
- 16 channel LiDAR data (cyber channel /apollo/sensor/lidar_front, lidar_rear_left, lidar_rear_right)
- Radar data (cyber channel /apollo/sensor/radar_front, radar_rear)
- Image data (cyber channel /apollo/sensor/camera/front_6mm, front_12mm)
- Extrinsic parameters of radar sensor calibration (from YAML files)
- Extrinsic and Intrinsic parameters of front camera calibration (from YAML files)
- Velocity and Angular Velocity of host vehicle (cyber channel /apollo/localization/pose)

## Output

The perception module outputs are:

* The 3D obstacle tracks with the heading, velocity and classification information (cyber channel /apollo/perception/obstacles)
* The output of traffic light detection and recognition (cyber channel /apollo/perception/traffic_light)

### Note
1. Nvidia GPU and CUDA are required to run the perception module with Caffe. Apollo provides the CUDA and Caffe libraries in the release docker image. However, the Nvidia GPU driver is not installed in the dev docker image.

2. To run the perception module with CUDA acceleration, install the exact same version of the Nvidia driver in the docker image that is installed on your host machine, and then build Apollo with the GPU option (i.e., using `./apollo.sh build_opt_gpu`).

    See [How to Run Perception Module on Your Local Computer](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/docs/howto/how_to_run_perception_module_on_your_local_computer.md).
