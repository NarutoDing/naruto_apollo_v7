# Prediction

## Introduction
The Prediction module studies and predicts the behavior of all the obstacles detected by the perception module.
Prediction receives obstacle data along with basic perception information including positions, headings, velocities, accelerations, and then generates predicted trajectories with probabilities for those obstacles.

In **Apollo 5.5**, the Prediction module introduces a new model - **Caution Obstacle**. Together with aggressively emphasizing on caution when proceeding to a junction, this model will now scan all obstacles that have entered the junction as long as computing resources permit. The Semantic LSTM Evaluator and the Extrapolation Predictor have also been introduced in Apolo 5.5 to support the Caution Obstacle model.

```
Note:
The Prediction module only predicts the behavior of obstacles and not the EGO car. The Planning module plans the trajectory of the EGO car.

```

## Input
  * Obstacles information from the perception module
  * Localization information from the localization module
  * Planning trajectory of the previous computing cycle from the planning module

## Output
  * Obstacles annotated with predicted trajectories and their priorities. Obstacle priority is now calculated as individual scenarios are prioritized differently. The priorities include: ignore, caution and normal (default)

## Functionalities

Based on the figure below, the prediction module comprises 4 main functionalities: Container, Scenario, Evaluator and Predictor.  Container, Evaluator and Predictor existed in Apollo 3.0. In Apollo 3.5, we introduced the Scenario functionality as we have moved towards a more scenario-based approach for Apollo's autonomous driving capabilities.

### Container

Container stores input data from subscribed channels. Current supported
inputs are **_perception obstacles_**, **_vehicle localization_** and **_vehicle planning_**.

### Scenario

The Scenario sub-module analyzes scenarios that includes the ego vehicle.
Currently, we have two defined scenarios:
- **Cruise** : this scenario includes Lane keeping and following
- **Junction** : this scenario involves junctions. Junctions can either have traffic lights and/or STOP signs

### Obstacles

- **Ignore**: these obstacles will not affect the ego car's trajectory and can be safely ignored (E.g. the obstacle is too far away)
- **Caution**: these obstacles have a high possibility of interacting with the ego car
- **Normal**: the obstacles that do not fall under ignore or caution are placed by default under normal


### Evaluator

The Evaluator predicts path and speed separately for any given obstacle.
An evaluator evaluates a path by outputting a probability for it (lane
sequence) using the given model stored in _prediction/data/_.

The list of available evaluators include:

* **Cost evaluator**: probability is calculated by a set of cost functions

* **MLP evaluator**: probability is calculated using an MLP model

* **RNN evaluator**: probability is calculated using an RNN model

* **Cruise MLP + CNN-1d evaluator**: probability is calculated using a mix of MLP and CNN-1d models for the cruise scenario

* **Junction MLP evaluator**: probability is calculated using an MLP model for junction scenario

* **Junction Map evaluator**: probability is calculated using an semantic map-based CNN model for junction scenario. This evaluator was created for caution level obstacles

* **Social Interaction evaluator**: this model is used for pedestrians, for short term trajectory prediction. It uses social LSTM. This evaluator was created for caution level obstacles

* **Semantic LSTM evaluator**: this evaluator is used in the new Caution Obstacle model to generate short term trajectory points which are calculated using CNN and LSTM. Both vehicles and pedestrians are using this same model, but with different parameters

* **Vectornet LSTM evaluator**: this evaluator is used in place of Semantic LSTM evaluator to generate short term trajectory points for "Caution" tagged obstacles. More detail is in [vectornet lstm evaluator readme](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/docs/technical_documents/vectornet_lstm_evaluator.md).

* **Jointly prediction planning evaluator**: this evaluator is used in the new Interactive Obstacle(vehicle-type) model to generate short term trajectory points which are calculated using Vectornet and LSTM. By considering ADC's trajectory info, the obstacle trajectory prediction can be more accurate under interaction scenario. Please refer [jointly prediction planning evaluator](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/blob/master/docs/technical_documents/jointly_prediction_planning_evaluator.md).

### Predictor

Predictor generates predicted trajectories for obstacles. Currently, the supported predictors include:

* **Empty**: obstacles have no predicted trajectories
* **Single lane**: Obstacles move along a single lane in highway navigation mode. Obstacles not on lane will be ignored.
* **Lane sequence**: obstacle moves along the lanes
* **Move sequence**: obstacle moves along the lanes by following its kinetic pattern
* **Free movement**: obstacle moves freely
* **Regional movement**: obstacle moves in a possible region
* **Junction**: Obstacles move toward junction exits with high probabilities
* **Interaction predictor**: compute the likelihood to create posterior prediction results after all evaluators have run. This predictor was created for caution level obstacles
* **Extrapolation predictor**: extends the Semantic LSTM evaluator's results to create an 8 sec trajectory.

## Prediction Architecture

The prediction module estimates the future motion trajectories for all perceived obstacles. The output prediction message wraps the perception information. Prediction both subscribes to and is triggered by perception obstacle messages, as shown below:

The prediction module also takes messages from both localization and planning as input. The structure is shown below:
